# Myofibroblast-Mouse-analysis
In this project we focus on selecting Pdgfra-high and Acta2+ fibroblasts from the mouse intestine to form a specific cell pool for sc-RNA-seq. The idea is to investigate the heterogeneity and identify potential upstream signaling pathways relevant to intestinal myofibroblasts.
